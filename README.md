# Brick-Breaker-Game-Java
 Welcome to the Brick Breaker game repository! This classic arcade game brings back nostalgic memories and offers an exciting gaming experience. 
 
## Overview
The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the BRICKS that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks get broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the game moves based on user input. The player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit a BALL. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen. But, if the ball hits the bottom enclosure, the player loses and the game ends! To win the game, the player has to eliminate all the BRICKS in the respective levels.
 

## Gameplay and Features
Power-ups: Consider adding power-ups that can enhance the paddle, slow down the ball, or provide other advantages.
Obstacles: Introduce obstacles that challenge the player's ability to navigate the ball.
Level Progression: Design levels with increasing difficulty. You can vary the brick patterns and introduce new challenges in each level.
Controls:

Game Over/Win Screen:
Game Over Screen: Display a game over screen when the player runs out of lives.
Win Screen: Celebrate the player's victory with a win screen when they complete all levels.

## Future Scope
Our project will be able to implement in future after making some changes and modifications as we make our project at a very low level. So the modifications that can be done in our project are:
It can be made with good graphics.
We can add more option like Top Score and Player Profile.
We can add multiplayer option.
